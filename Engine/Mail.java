public class Mail {
    // Good news #1: Java has a mail API to make sending mail relatively painless
    // Bad news #1: That API is only available in the Enterprise Edition. We'll need to see what Bhola is expecting us to use.
    // Good news #2: It IS possible to implement mail sending through SMTP in Java Standard Edition
    // Bad news #2: It's pretty damn complicated to implement it using SMTP in Standard Edition and is essentially a project itself
    // Good news #3: I have actually done that before in Networking class (made a Java mail client using SMTP)
    // Bad news #3: I don't know where my old code is, haha.
