CSc4350 Project Files

The batch file provided here will both build the project and, with the command line argument "y" used, will also run it.
	- This will only work within Windows OS, for Linux/Mac an alternative script will be needed.

About the GUI:
-The main class that runs the program is called HotelManagementSystem.java and is located in the Engine class.
-All of the .form files are only used by the NetBeans IDE for their point-and-click GUI creation tool and will not be included in our final product. You can safely ignore all of the .form files if you are not using the NetBeans IDE.
