About the GUI:
-The main class that runs the program is called HotelManagementSystem.java and is located in the Engine class.
-All of the .form files are only used by the NetBeans IDE for their point-and-click GUI creation tool and will not be included   in our final product. You can safely ignore all of the .form files if you are not using the NetBeans IDE.
